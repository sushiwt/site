      <br>
      <p class="big-p">
        I LOVE video games, mostly first person shooters (like Half Life, Portal, <br>
        Super Mario Odyssey), but I can enjoy playing any video game genre! <br>
        <br>
        I'm also a HUGE fangirl for Valve (the “””“game”””” company)!!!

      <p class="large">-- things that i do (and what i am learning rn) --</p>
      <br>
      <p class="big-p">
        I can code games and websites, make 3d models of random stuff, <br>
        do drawing, and animate, but I mostly code and 3d model… <br>
        <br>
        I am currently learning JavaScript, a scripting language used for websites <br>
        (there's actually a little bit of javascript being used in this site :>) and <br>
        GDScript, which is the programming language that Godot, a game engine, uses. <br>
      </p>

    <div>
      <p class="large">-- what i use to create my stuff --</p>
      <br>
      <p class="big-p">
        I use Clickteam Fusion 2.5 to code my games, but I'm slowly leaving it for <br>
        Godot, because of...well, I dont know actually.... <br>
        <br>
        I use Blender to create my 3d models, but I am still learning how to use it… <br>
        (I know how to texture and model and stuff, but I still don't know how to use scripts, or compositing, or
        rigging :<) <br>
          <br>
          For computers, I use a Microsoft Surface Go 2 for stuff like animating <br>
          and drawing, while I use a MacBook Pro to 3d model and code the website<br>
          you are using right now!! <br>
