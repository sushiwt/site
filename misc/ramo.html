    <h1>Ramo and the Kingdoms (the sushi edition)</h1>
    <hr>

    <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <p>Ramo wakes up in a space of glass shards and reflective windows and clocks. He walks and jumps through the reflective platforms, careful not to fall into what looks like an infinite void. After walking for a while, he stumbles into something massive. A control panel with this hourglass like look. Surrounding it are orbs, each having unique colors, being Purple, Orange, Green, Blue, White, Teal, Brown, and Yellow. Ramo notices a blue figure in the distance using the control panel.
            
        <br>    
        <br>
        Ramo: Heyo?   
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        The blue figure turns around.    
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        ????: oh. you finally arrived.
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        Ramo: Um, who are you?
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        ????: that’s not really necessary. come here. i want to show you something.
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        Ramo: Okay?
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        Ramo gets closer to the blue figure, and upon closer inspection, it looks human, but with blue skin, blue hair, and blue overalls.
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        ????: have you ever heard of the octet?
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        Ramo: Um, no?
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        ????: that’s alright. no one has nowadays.
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        The orbs expand into portals, each showing a unique kingdom on the other side. 
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        ????: a long time ago, the planet we live on consisted of eight kingdoms called the octet. the fire kingdom, the nature kingdom,
         the water kingdom, the ice kingdom, the wind kingdom, the rock kingdom, the light kingdom, and the electrix. 
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        they all used to live in peace under our control, the time and darkness, me being time, and my partner, being darkness. my partner 
        though, had other plans. 
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        as an anonymous messenger, he dropped a letter infront of the fire kingdom’s castle, falsely accusing the nature kingdom for stealing 
        their resources. once the fire kingdom’s king found the letter, he unleashed an attack to the nature kingdom.
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        the nature kingdom did not know why they started attacking, but in response, they attacked back. unfortunately, the nature kingdom was 
        vastly inferior to the fire kingdom, and so they lost the battle. things were looking grim for the nature kingdom and it seemed like all 
        hope was lost, until the water kingdom came along and healed them. 
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        eventually, every kingdom, from wind, to rock, to light, started getting involved in the war. there was blood everywhere, and people were being 
        stabbed, hit, choked, frozen, and burnt. it seemed like everyone was going all in on the war, but little do they know, there was one kingdom that 
        stayed away. the electrix kingdom. the electrix kingdom was a kingdom consisting of humans, which were the weakest living beings compared to the 
        other kingdoms, but the power they held, the electrix, was the most powerful. they had the ability to generate solid matter, electrocute any living 
        being near it, and create a shield so impenetrable that the sharpest tool cannot create a dent. even with these powers though, they stayed quiet. 
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        300 years later, the war has ended. many lives were lost in the battle, including the leaders of the kingdoms involved in the war. 
        the survivors though, started to live together again, and this time, they would not be separated anymore, but combined into one. 
        they called this, the unified. everyone in every kingdom was happy to join in the newly built group, except one; the electrix kingdom, which had 
        been silent the whole time. when the unified approached the electrix kingdom though, all everyone saw were humans. the unified asked the 
        humans if they wanted to join in the unified, and everybody voted for yes. and now, today.
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        Ramo: Hm. 
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        ????: The only problem now is…my partner is still around, and even worse, he has found you.
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        Ramo: …what? Why me? Why am I involved in any of this??
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        ????: because you’re the only living being in the world that still has the electrix.
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        Ramo: Oh.
        
        <br>    
        <br>
        ????: awaken it as soon as possible. you’re our only hope.
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        Ramo drifts apart from the blue figure and the hourglass control panel while it shatters itself. He goes farther and farther until everything is black. 
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        Then the alarm clock beeps.
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        Ramo wakes up, punches the alarm clock shut, and rubs his eyes.
        <br>    
        <br>
        
        Ramo: That was the weirdest dream I have ever gotten.
        <br>    
        <br>
